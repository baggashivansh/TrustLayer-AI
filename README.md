TrustLayer-AI

Overview

TrustLayer is a secure AI usage layer designed to help organizations adopt AI safely with internal data. It focuses on controlled access, visibility, and operational trust while using AI agents connected through Model Context Protocol infrastructure powered by the Archestra platform.

Problem Statement

Organizations want to use AI for productivity, automation, and knowledge discovery. However three concerns slow adoption.

1. Risk of sensitive data exposure when employees use public AI tools


2. Lack of visibility into how AI accesses company data


3. Uncontrolled cost and unclear operational governance



TrustLayer addresses these concerns by introducing a structured and observable AI access layer.

Solution

TrustLayer provides a centralized AI interaction layer where company data can be accessed securely through governed AI agents. The platform emphasizes safety, visibility, and responsible AI deployment rather than experimental AI demos.

How It Works

1. Internal documents, repositories, or knowledge sources are exposed through MCP compatible tools


2. AI agents access these tools only through controlled orchestration provided by Archestra


3. Every request is logged with context, usage information, and cost visibility


4. Security policies restrict sensitive access and reduce data exposure risks



Architecture Direction

TrustLayer is designed around these core components.

1. MCP based agents connected to enterprise data sources


2. Archestra orchestration layer for governance, observability, and access control


3. AI model routing with cost and usage tracking


4. Lightweight interface for secure internal AI interaction



Key Goals

1. Demonstrate safe enterprise AI adoption


2. Provide observability into AI usage patterns


3. Show cost awareness and governance practices


4. Encourage responsible AI infrastructure design



Hackathon Context

This project is being developed as part of the WeMakeDevs online hackathon called 2 Fast 2 MCP. The hackathon focuses on building secure, observable, and scalable AI agent systems using MCP infrastructure and the Archestra platform.

Planned Next Steps

1. Initial MCP server integration for internal knowledge access


2. Observability demonstration using Archestra dashboards


3. Security scenario demonstration such as restricted data access


4. Deployment workflow refinement for production style setup
